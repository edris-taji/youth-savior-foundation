                Mr. Hossainy has always been deeply passionate about civic and human rights issues. Growing up in a
                politically active
                and socially conscious family, he was exposed early on to the injustices and inequalities that exist in
                many
                communities around the world. Mr. Hossainy became increasingly involved in various advocacy groups and
                social justice
                organizations, dedicated to promoting equality, justice and sustainable development. In 2020, Hosseini
                became a member
                of Afghanistan's most powerful political party "JAMIAT-E-ISLAMI AFGHANISTAN". Due to his leadership
                skills
                and his
                charismatic personality, Hosseini became the youth representative of "Jamiat-e-Islami" in the western

                    <b>Introduction</b>
                    <p>
                      Education is a fundamental human right and a key factor for social and economic development.
                      However, in Afghanistan,
                      girls and women have been systematically denied this right for decades, especially under the
                      Taliban regime. The recent
                      takeover of power by the Taliban in August 2021 has reversed the significant progress made in
                      girls’ education in the
                      past 20 years and put millions of girls and young women at risk of losing their access to formal
                      education. This article
                      will explore the history, challenges and prospects of girls’ education in Afghanistan, and
                      highlight the importance of
                      international support and advocacy for the rights of Afghan women and girls.
                    </p>
                    <b>History of Girls’ Education in Afghanistan</b>
                    <p>
                      Girls’ education in Afghanistan has a long and turbulent history, marked by periods of progress
                      and regression depending
                      on the political and security situation in the country. Before the Soviet invasion in 1979,
                      Afghanistan had a relatively
                      modern education system that was open to both boys and girls. However, the subsequent civil war
                      and the rise of the
                      Taliban in the 1990s severely disrupted the education sector and imposed strict restrictions on
                      girls’ education.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Under the Taliban rule, girls were banned from attending school and women were prohibited from
                      working as teachers or
                      administrators. Only a few clandestine schools operated by brave individuals or organizations
                      provided some
                      opportunities for girls to learn in secret.
                      After the fall of the Taliban regime in 2001, girls’ education became a priority for the new
                      government and its
                      international partners. With the support of various donors and agencies, such as UNESCO, UNICEF,
                      USAID and others,
                      millions of girls returned to school and thousands of female teachers were trained and employed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The number of girls enrolled in primary school increased from almost zero in 2001 to 2.5 million
                      in 20181. The number of
                      women in higher education increased almost 20 times, from 5,000 female students in 2001 to over
                      100,000 in 2021.
                      Literacy rates for women doubled during the period, from 17% of women being able to read and write
                      in 2001 to nearly 30%
                      for all age groups combined.
                    </p>
                    <p>However, despite these achievements, girls’ education still faced many challenges and barriers,
                      such as insecurity,
                      poverty, cultural norms, social stigma, early marriage, lack of infrastructure and qualified
                      teachers, and gender-based
                      violence. According to UNESCO. nearly 30% of girls in Afghanistan have never entered primary
                      education. In rural areas,
                      where most of the population lives, only 15% of girl’s complete primary school compared to 51% of
                      boys. The gender gap
                      widens further at higher levels of education, with only 5% of rural girls reaching secondary
                      school compared to 32% of
                      rural boys. Moreover, many schools have been attacked or closed due to conflict or threats by
                      armed groups, affecting
                      millions of students and teachers.</p>
                    <b>Current Situation of Girls’ Education in Afghanistan</b>
                    <p>The current situation of girls’ education in Afghanistan is dire and uncertain. Since the Taliban
                      takeover of power in
                      August 2021, they have banned secondary education for girls and suspended university education for
                      women until further
                      notice. This means that over 1.1 million girls and young women are currently deprived of their
                      right to formal
                      education1. The Taliban have claimed that they will allow girls to resume their studies once they
                      establish a "safe
                      learning environment" that conforms to their interpretation of Islamic law. However, they have not
                      provided any clear
                      timeline or details on what this entails or how it will be implemented.</p>
                    <p>The Taliban’s ban on girls’ education has sparked widespread condemnation and concern from the
                      international community,
                      human rights groups, civil society organizations, and Afghan women themselves. Many fear that the
                      ban will erase the
                      gains made in girls’ education over the past two decades and push millions of girls into
                      illiteracy, poverty,
                      marginalization and vulnerability. Some also worry that the ban will be used as a bargaining chip
                      by the Taliban to gain
                      recognition or legitimacy from other countries or entities.</p>
                    <p>Despite the ban, some girls and teachers are risking their lives to attend secret schools or
                      home-based classes
                      organized by courageous individuals or groups who believe in the value and power of education.
                      These informal
                      initiatives provide some hope and resilience for those who refuse to give up on their dreams and
                      aspirations. However,
                      they also face many challenges and dangers, such as lack of resources, harassment, intimidation,
                      and violence.</p>
                    <b>Prospects and Recommendations for Girls’ Education in Afghanistan</b>
                    <p>The prospects and recommendations for girls’ education in Afghanistan depend largely on the
                      political and security
                      situation in the country, as well as the international response and engagement. The Taliban’s ban
                      on girls’ education is
                      not only a violation of human rights, but also a threat to the development and stability of
                      Afghanistan and the region.
                      Educated women are essential for the social, economic, and political progress of any society, as
                      they contribute to
                      various sectors and fields, such as health, agriculture, business, governance, peacebuilding, and
                      more. Moreover,
                      educating girls has positive spillover effects on their families and communities, such as reducing
                      child mortality,
                      improving maternal health, increasing income, enhancing civic participation, and preventing
                      radicalization.</p>
                    <p>Therefore, it is imperative that the international community continues to support and advocate
                      for the rights of Afghan
                      women and girls to access quality education at all levels. Some of the possible actions that can
                      be taken are:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Applying diplomatic pressure and sanctions on the Taliban to respect and protect the rights of
                        women and girls, especially their right to education, as a condition for any recognition or
                        cooperation.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Providing humanitarian assistance and protection to girls and women who are displaced,
                        vulnerable, or at risk due to the conflict or the ban on education.
                      </li>
                      Supporting civil society organizations and local initiatives that are working to provide
                      informal or alternative education opportunities for girls and women in Afghanistan.
                      <li>
                        Promoting dialogue and engagement with religious and community leaders who can influence the
                        attitudes and behaviors of the Taliban and the society towards girls’ education.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Monitoring and documenting the situation of girls’ education in Afghanistan and raising
                        awareness about its importance and challenges.
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <b>Conclusion</b>
                    <p>Girls’ education in Afghanistan is a critical issue that affects not only the lives and futures
                      of millions of girls and
                      women, but also the development and peace of the country and the region. The Taliban’s ban on
                      girls’ education is a
                      retrograde step that undermines the progress made in the past 20 years and violates the human
                      rights of half of the
                      population. The international community must not abandon or ignore the plight of Afghan women and
                      girls, but rather
                      stand with them in solidarity and support. Education is a powerful tool for empowerment,
                      transformation, and resilience.
                      It is also a source of hope and dignity for those who seek to overcome oppression and adversity.

                  Social justice is a term that has been used to describe the fair treatment and equitable status of all

                    <p>
                      Social justice is a term that has been used to describe the fair treatment and equitable status of
                      all individuals and
                      social groups within a state or society. It is based on the idea that all people should have the
                      same rights and
                      opportunities and that a country’s wealth and resources should benefit everyone in that country.
                      Social justice also
                      aims to promote the common good, foster individual self-development and self-determination, and
                      protect human rights.
                    </p>
                    <p>Social justice matters because it reflects the values and principles of a democratic society. It
                      challenges the existing
                      inequalities, injustices, and oppressions that affect millions of people around the world. It
                      recognizes the dignity and
                      worth of every human being and strives to create a more inclusive, diverse, and respectful
                      society.</p>
                    <p>Some of the main principles of social justice are:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Equality: Everyone should be treated equally and fairly regardless of their race, gender,
                        religion, ethnicity, sexual orientation, disability, or any other characteristic. Equality means
                        ensuring that everyone has equal access to opportunities, resources, and services that meet
                        their needs and aspirations.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Equity: Everyone should receive what they need to achieve their full potential and overcome
                        the barriers that limit their opportunities. Equity means recognizing and addressing the
                        historical and structural disadvantages that some groups face and providing them with additional
                        support or compensation.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Diversity: Everyone should be valued and respected for their unique identities, cultures,
                        perspectives, and experiences. Diversity means celebrating the differences that enrich our
                        society and fostering a sense of belonging and inclusion for all.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Participation: Everyone should have a voice and a say in the decisions that affect their lives
                        and communities. Participation means ensuring that people can exercise their civil and political
                        rights, such as voting, protesting, organizing, or petitioning. It also means creating spaces
                        for dialogue, consultation, collaboration, and co-creation among different stakeholders.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Human rights: Everyone should enjoy the basic rights and freedoms that are essential for a
                        dignified and decent life. Human rights are universal, indivisible, interdependent, and
                        inalienable. They include civil and political rights (such as the rights to life, liberty,
                        expression, and assembly), economic and social rights (such as the rights to work, education,
                        health, and social security), and solidarity or group rights (such as the rights to
                        self-determination, development, and environmental protection)1.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <ul>
                      <p>
                        Social justice is not only a moral obligation but also a legal obligation. Many countries have
                        adopted constitutions, laws, policies, or international treaties that uphold the principles of
                        social justice. Some examples are:
                      </p>
                      <li>
                        The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948), which proclaims that “all human beings are
                        born free and equal in dignity and rights” and sets out a range of civil, political, economic,
                        social, and cultural rights for everyone.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (1966), which recognizes
                        the
                        right of everyone to an adequate standard of living, including food, clothing, housing, health
                        care, education, social security, and cultural participation.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (1979), which
                        affirms the equal rights of women in all spheres of life and calls for the elimination of all
                        forms of discrimination and violence against women.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (2006), which promotes the full
                        inclusion and participation of persons with disabilities in society and protects their rights
                        to
                        accessibility, autonomy, equality, dignity, respect, and justice.
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        The Sustainable Development Goals (2015), which are a set of 17 global goals that aim to end
                        poverty, protect the planet, and ensure peace and prosperity for all by 2030.
                      </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Social justice is not only a goal but also a process. It requires constant efforts from
                      individuals, groups,
                      organizations, and governments to challenge and change the status quo and to create and sustain a
                      more just and fair
                      society for all. Social justice is not only a responsibility but also an opportunity. It offers us
                      a chance to build
                      bridges across differences, to learn from each other, to collaborate for common causes, and to
                      contribute to the
                      well-being of ourselves and others.</p>
                    <p>
                      Social justice is not only a concept but also a practice. It invites us to ask ourselves: How can
                      we make our society
                      more just? How can we respect and value the diversity of our society? How can we ensure that
                      everyone has a voice and a
                      choice in our society? How can we protect and promote the human rights of our society? How can we
                      work together to
                      achieve the social justice of our society?
                    </p>

                    </h1>
                    <b>Introduction</b>
                    <p>
                      Women’s political participation is a fundamental prerequisite for gender equality and genuine
                      democracy. It facilitates
                      women’s direct engagement in public decision-making and is a means of ensuring better
                      accountability to women. However,
                      data show that women are underrepresented at all levels of decision-making worldwide and that
                      achieving gender parity in
                      political life is far off. This article will explore some of the facts and figures, challenges and
                      opportunities, and
                      recommendations for enhancing women’s political participation.
                    </p>
                    <b>Facts and Figures</b>
                    <p>
                      According to UN Women, as of 1 January 2023, there are 31 countries where 34 women serve as Heads
                      of State and/or
                      Government. However, at the current rate, gender equality in the highest positions of power will
                      not be reached for
                      another 130 years. Just 17 countries have a woman Head of State, and 19 countries have a woman
                      Head of Government.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Women also face barriers to access ministerial positions. First-time compiled data by UN Women
                      show that women represent
                      22.8 percent of Cabinet members heading Ministries, leading a policy area as of 1 January 2023.
                      There are only 13
                      countries in which women hold 50 percent or more of the positions of Cabinet Ministers leading
                      policy areas. The five
                      most commonly held portfolios by women Cabinet Ministers Are Women and gender equality, followed
                      by Family and children
                      affairs, Social inclusion and development, Social protection and social security, and Indigenous
                      and minority affairs.
                    </p>
                    <p>In national parliaments, women account for only 26.5 per cent of parliamentarians in single or
                      lower houses, up from 11
                      per cent in 1995. Only six countries have 50 per cent or more women in parliament in single or
                      lower houses: Rwanda (61
                      per cent), Cuba (53 per cent), Nicaragua (52 per cent), Mexico (50 per cent), New Zealand (50 per
                      cent), and the United
                      Arab Emirates (50 per cent). At the current rate of progress, gender parity in national
                      legislative bodies will not be
                      achieved before 2063.</p>
                    <p>Women’s representation varies across regions and countries. Women hold 36 per cent of
                      parliamentary seats in Latin
                      America and the Caribbean and make up 32 per cent of parliamentarians in Europe and Northern
                      America. In Sub-Saharan
                      Africa, there are 26 per cent of women legislators followed by Eastern and South-Eastern Asia with
                      22 per cent, Oceania
                      with 20 per cent, Central and Southern Asia with 19 per cent and Northern Africa and Western Asia
                      with 18 per cent of
                      women Members of Parliament.</p>
                    <p>At the local level, data from 136 countries shows that women constitute nearly 3 million (34 per
                      cent) of elected
                      members in local deliberative bodies.</p>
                    <b>Challenges and Opportunities</b>
                    <p>Women face several obstacles to participating in political life. Structural barriers through
                      discriminatory laws and
                      institutions still limit women’s options to run for office. Capacity gaps mean women are less
                      likely than men to have
                      the education, contacts and resources needed to become effective leaders. As the 2011 UN General
                      Assembly resolution on
                      women’s political participation notes, “Women in every part of the world continue to be largely
                      marginalized from the
                      political sphere, often as a result of discriminatory laws, practices, attitudes and gender
                      stereotypes, low levels of
                      education, lack of access to health care and the disproportionate effect of poverty on women.”</p>
                    <b>Some of the specific challenges that women encounter includes:</b>

                    <ul>
                      <li>
                        Lack of political will and commitment from political parties, governments and other stakeholders
                        to promote women’s political participation
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Lack of legal frameworks or enforcement mechanisms that guarantee women’s equal rights and
                        opportunities to participate in public life
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Lack of financial resources and support for women candidates and elected officials
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Lack of access to media coverage and visibility for women’s issues and perspectives
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Lack of training and mentoring for women leaders and aspiring candidates
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Lack of safety and security for women involved in politics
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Lack of solidarity and networking among women across political parties, sectors and movements
                      </li>
                      <li>
                        Lack of recognition and appreciation for women’s contributions and achievements in politics
                      </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Despite these challenges, there are also many opportunities for advancing women’s political
                      participation. Some of these
                      include:</p>
                    <ul>

                      <li>

                    <b>Conclusion</b>
                    <p>Women’s political participation is essential for achieving gender equality and genuine democracy.
                      However, women face
                      many barriers to participating in political life. To overcome these barriers, concerted efforts
                      are needed from all
                      stakeholders, including political parties, governments, civil society, media, regional and
                      international organizations,
                      and women themselves. By enhancing women’s political participation, we can create a more
                      inclusive, representative and
                      responsive political system that works for all.</p>

                  Afghanistan has been a country that has been plagued by war

                    <p>
                      Afghanistan has been a country that has been plagued by
                      war and conflict for decades, and the human rights
                      situation in the country has been a major concern for
                      the international community. The situation in
                      Afghanistan is complex, with many different groups vying
                      for power and control, and this has led to a range of
                      human rights abuses.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One of the most significant issues facing Afghanistan is
                      the treatment of women and girls. Women in Afghanistan
                      face a range of challenges, including discrimination,
                      violence, and limited access to education and
                      healthcare. The Taliban regime, which ruled the country
                      from 1996 to 2001, enforced strict laws and customs that
                      severely restricted the rights and freedoms of women.
                      While progress has been made since then, women and girls
                      in Afghanistan still face significant challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Another major issue facing Afghanistan is the treatment
                      of ethnic and religious minorities. The Hazara
                      community, in particular, has faced discrimination and
                      violence, and there have been reports of targeted
                      killings and other abuses. The country's Shi'a Muslim
                      minority has also faced persecution, and there have been
                      reports of attacks on their places of worship. Freedom
                      of expression and the press is another area of concern
                      in Afghanistan. Journalists and activists have been
                      targeted and threatened, and there have been reports of
                      censorship and restrictions on the media. The government
                      has also been accused of cracking down on dissent and
                      opposition voices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The human rights situation in Afghanistan is further
                      complicated by the ongoing conflict and the presence of
                      armed groups. Civilians have been caught in the
                      crossfire, and there have been reports of civilian
                      casualties and human rights abuses by all sides. The use
                      of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) has also led to
                      high numbers of civilian casualties.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Despite these challenges, there have been some positive
                      developments in Afghanistan in recent years. The country
                      has made progress in improving access to education and
                      healthcare, and there have been efforts to promote
                      gender equality and women's rights. The Afghan
                      government has also taken steps to address some of the
                      human rights abuses, including by signing international
                      human rights treaties and establishing institutions to
                      monitor and promote human rights. However, much more
                      needs to be done to improve the human rights situation
                      in Afghanistan. The international community has an
                      important role to play in supporting the Afghan
                      government and civil society organizations in their
                      efforts to promote and protect human rights. This
                      includes providing financial support, technical
                      assistance, and diplomatic pressure to address human
                      rights abuses and promote reforms.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In conclusion, the human rights situation in Afghanistan
                      remains a major concern, with many different challenges
                      facing the country. While progress has been made in some
                      areas, much more needs to be done to promote and protect
                      the rights and freedoms of all Afghans, particularly
                      women and minorities. The international community must
                      continue to support the Afghan government and civil
                      society organizations in their efforts to improve the
                      human rights situation in the country.

                      Religious pluralism from Rumi's point of view
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                      Jalaluddin Rumi, the 13th-century Persian poet,
                      theologian, and mystic, is known for his writings on
                      love, spirituality, and the search for truth. Rumi's
                      teachings emphasize the importance of religious
                      pluralism, the idea that multiple religions can coexist
                      and be appreciated for their unique perspectives on the
                      divine. Rumi's perspective on religious pluralism is
                      rooted in his Sufi beliefs and his deep respect for all
                      religions. Rumi believed that all religions are
                      ultimately seeking the same truth and that there are
                      many paths to reach that truth. He wrote, "The lamps are
                      different, but the light is the same." Rumi believed
                      that different religions are like different lamps,
                      illuminating different facets of the same divine truth.
                      He argued that there is no need for conflict or
                      animosity between religions, as they are all ultimately
                      seeking the same thing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Rumi's teachings on religious pluralism are also
                      reflected in his poetry. In many of his poems, Rumi uses
                      imagery and symbolism from different religions to
                      illustrate his points. For example, he often uses
                      Christian and Islamic metaphors side by side to show the
                      universality of his message. This approach allows Rumi
                      to speak to people of all faiths and to show that the
                      teachings of different religions can be complementary
                      rather than contradictory.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Rumi's teachings on religious pluralism are particularly
                      relevant today, as the world is becoming increasingly
                      diverse and interconnected. In many parts of the world,
                      people of different religions and cultures are living
                      side by side. Rumi's perspective on religious pluralism
                      can help to promote understanding and respect between
                      different communities, and to foster a sense of unity
                      and shared humanity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      However, Rumi's teachings on religious pluralism are not
                      without their challenges. In some cases, religious
                      differences can be a source of conflict, and it can be
                      difficult to reconcile different beliefs and practices.
                      Rumi's perspective on religious pluralism requires a
                      willingness to look beyond surface-level differences and
                      to appreciate the underlying spiritual truths that unite
                      all religions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In conclusion, Rumi's teachings on religious pluralism
                      emphasize the importance of recognizing the
                      commonalities between different religions and
                      appreciating the unique perspectives that each religion
                      brings. Rumi's perspective on religious pluralism is
                      rooted in his Sufi beliefs and his deep respect for all
                      religions. His teachings are particularly relevant
                      today, as the world becomes increasingly diverse and
                      interconnected. Rumi's teachings on religious pluralism
                      can help to promote understanding and respect between
                      different communities and to foster a sense of unity and
                      shared humanity.

                  Social justice is a concept that refers to the fair and
                  equitable distribution of resources, opportunities, and
                  privileges among all members of a society. It is an ideal
                  that aims to eliminate inequality, discrimination, and

                      Social justice is a concept that refers to the fair and
                      equitable distribution of resources, opportunities, and
                      privileges among all members of a society. It is an
                      ideal that aims to eliminate inequality, discrimination,
                      and oppression in all forms, and to ensure that all
                      individuals have access to the basic necessities of
                      life, such as education, healthcare, and housing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      At its core, social justice is about creating a society
                      that values and respects the inherent dignity and worth
                      of every individual, regardless of their race,
                      ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, or
                      socioeconomic status. It recognizes that not all members
                      of a society have the same access to resources and
                      opportunities, and seeks to rectify this by promoting
                      policies and practices that promote equity and
                      inclusion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      One of the key components of social justice is the
                      promotion of human rights. This includes the right to
                      life, liberty, and security of person, as well as other
                      basic rights such as the right to education, healthcare,
                      and housing. Social justice also encompasses the right
                      to equal treatment under the law, regardless of one's
                      race, ethnicity, gender, or other characteristics. This
                      requires the elimination of systemic racism, sexism, and
                      other forms of discrimination that create barriers to
                      equal opportunities and outcomes for all members of
                      society.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Another important aspect of social justice is the
                      concept of distributive justice. This refers to the fair
                      and equitable distribution of resources and
                      opportunities among members of society. This includes
                      access to education, healthcare, and other public
                      services, as well as economic resources such as wealth
                      and income. Distributive justice recognizes that not all
                      members of society have the same access to these
                      resources, and seeks to address this through policies
                      and programs that promote equal access and opportunity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Social justice also involves the promotion of procedural
                      justice, which refers to the fair and equitable
                      administration of laws and policies. This includes
                      ensuring that all individuals have equal access to the
                      legal system, and that laws and policies are applied
                      fairly and consistently across all members of society.
                      Finally, social justice requires the active
                      participation and engagement of individuals and
                      communities. This means that all members of society have
                      a responsibility to promote and uphold social justice,
                      and to work towards the elimination of inequality and
                      discrimination in all forms. This includes speaking out
                      against injustice, advocating for policies and programs
                      that promote equity and inclusion, and actively working
                      to create a more just and equitable society.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In conclusion, social justice is a fundamental concept
                      that seeks to promote fairness, equity, and inclusion in
                      all aspects of society. It recognizes that not all
                      members of society have the same access to resources and
                      opportunities, and seeks to rectify this through
                      policies and practices that promote human rights,
                      distributive justice, procedural justice, and active
                      engagement and participation. By working towards social
                      justice, we can create a society that values and
                      respects the inherent dignity and worth of every
                      individual, and that promotes equality, justice, and
                      opportunity for all.

                  Afghanistan has a long history of traditional and
                  patriarchal societies, where women's participation in
                  politics has been limited. However, in recent years, women

                    <p>
                      Afghanistan has a long history of traditional and
                      patriarchal societies, where women's participation in
                      politics has been limited. However, in recent years,
                      women in Afghanistan have been increasingly involved in
                      political activities, challenging societal norms and
                      advocating for their rights and representation. One of
                      the most significant milestones for women's political
                      participation in Afghanistan was the adoption of the
                      country's constitution in 2004, which included
                      provisions guaranteeing women's rights and their
                      participation in political life. Since then, women have
                      taken on various roles in politics, including as cabinet
                      ministers, members of parliament, and civil society
                      activists
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In 2018, Afghanistan held parliamentary elections, which
                      saw an increase in the number of women running for
                      office. More than 400 women stood as candidates, and 69
                      were elected to the parliament. This was a significant
                      increase from the 2010 parliamentary elections, where
                      only 68 women stood as candidates, and 28 were elected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Women's participation in politics has not been without
                      challenges and risks. Women who have entered politics or
                      taken on leadership roles have faced threats,
                      harassment, and violence, particularly from conservative
                      groups opposed to their involvement in politics. Female
                      politicians have been targeted by Taliban militants, and
                      there have been reports of female candidates being
                      threatened, kidnapped, or even killed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Despite these challenges, women in Afghanistan continue
                      to push for their rights and representation in politics.
                      Women's groups and civil society organizations have been
                      advocating for women's inclusion in peace talks and
                      negotiations, arguing that women's perspectives and
                      experiences are critical to achieving a sustainable and
                      inclusive peace.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Women's political participation has also been crucial in
                      advancing women's rights in Afghanistan. Women's groups
                      and activists have been advocating for reforms and
                      changes in laws and policies that discriminate against
                      women and limit their opportunities. For example,
                      women's rights activists have been advocating for
                      changes to the country's inheritance laws, which
                      currently favor male heirs over female heirs.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In conclusion, women's political participation in
                      Afghanistan has come a long way in recent years, but
                      there is still a long way to go. Women in Afghanistan
                      continue to face significant challenges and risks when
                      taking on political roles, but their participation is
                      crucial to achieving a sustainable and inclusive peace,
                      advancing women's rights, and promoting gender equality.
                      The Afghan government and the international community
                      must continue to support women's political participation
                      and work to address the challenges and risks they face.

                      Afghanistan has been ravaged by war and political
                      instability for decades, and this has had a significant
                      impact on the country's human rights situation. Despite
                      some progress in recent years, Afghanistan remains one
                      of the worst countries in the world for human rights
                      violations. This article will explore the current state
                      of human rights in Afghanistan and the challenges that
                      lie ahead.
                    </p>
                    <b>Freedom of Expression and Press:</b>
                    <p>
                      Freedom of expression and press are crucial components
                      of any democratic society, but in Afghanistan, they are
                      under constant threat. Journalists and media workers
                      face targeted attacks by the Taliban and other armed
                      groups, and many have been killed or intimidated into
                      silence. In addition, the government has been known to
                      restrict access to information and censor critical
                      reporting.
                    </p>
                    <b>Women's Rights: </b>
                    <p>
                      Afghanistan has one of the worst records when it comes
                      to women's rights. Women face widespread discrimination
                      and violence, and their access to education and
                      healthcare is limited. The Taliban's strict
                      interpretation of Islamic law has also led to the
                      imposition of harsh restrictions on women's freedoms,
                      including their ability to work and move freely in
                      public.
                    </p>
                    <b>Children's Rights:</b>
                    <p>
                      Children are among the most vulnerable groups in
                      Afghanistan, and they face a range of challenges,
                      including poverty, lack of access to education, and
                      recruitment by armed groups. Child marriage is also a
                      widespread issue, with many girls being forced into
                      marriage at a young age, which often leads to physical
                      and emotional abuse.
                    </p>
                    <b>The Way Forward:</b>
                    <p>
                      Despite these challenges, there have been some positive
                      developments in recent years. For example, in 2019,
                      Afghanistan passed a law criminalizing child marriage,
                      and there have been some efforts to promote women's
                      rights and gender equality. However, much more needs to
                      be done to ensure that all Afghans can enjoy their human
                      rights.

                    <p>
                      It is essential that the government takes steps to
                      protect freedom of expression and press, and ensure that
                      journalists and media workers can operate safely without
                      fear of reprisal. There needs to be greater investment
                      in education and healthcare, particularly for women and
                      children, and efforts must be made to address the root
                      causes of poverty and inequality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      In conclusion, Afghanistan faces significant challenges
                      when it comes to protecting human rights. However, with
                      the right policies and investments, there is hope that
                      the country can move towards a future where all Afghans
                      can enjoy their fundamental human rights.

                      Afghanistan’s opportunities and challenges in the next decade
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                      Afghanistan is facing a critical juncture in its history, as it adjusts to a new political and
                      economic reality
                      following the withdrawal of US and NATO forces and the takeover of the Taliban in August 2021. The
                      country is grappling
                      with multiple challenges, such as insecurity, poverty, humanitarian crisis, human rights
                      violations, regional
                      instability and isolation from the international community. At the same time, the country has some
                      opportunities to
                      leverage its natural resources, human capital, regional cooperation and potential dialogue with
                      the Taliban and other
                      stakeholders to achieve peace and development. This article will explore some of the main
                      opportunities and challenges
                      that Afghanistan will face in the next decade.
                    </p>
                    <b>Opportunities:</b>
                    <p>
                      One of the opportunities for Afghanistan is to exploit its rich mineral resources, which are
                      estimated to be worth up to
                      $3 trillion. Afghanistan has deposits of copper, iron, gold, lithium, rare earths and other
                      minerals that could generate
                      revenues and jobs for the country. China, which has invested in some of these projects, such as
                      the Mes Aynak copper
                      mine, has expressed interest in engaging with the Taliban and expanding its Belt and Road
                      Initiative (BRI) in
                      Afghanistan. However, developing these resources will require security, infrastructure, governance
                      and environmental
                      safeguards, which are currently lacking in Afghanistan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Another opportunity for Afghanistan is to invest in its human capital, especially its youth and
                      women. Afghanistan has a
                      young population, with more than 60% under the age of 25. Many of these young people have received
                      education and
                      training under the previous government and have aspirations for a better future. Women have also
                      made significant gains
                      in education, health and political participation over the past two decades. These human resources
                      could be harnessed to
                      contribute to the social and economic development of the country. However, this will depend on
                      whether the Taliban
                      respect human rights and allow women and girls to access education and work.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A third opportunity for Afghanistan is to enhance its regional cooperation and integration with
                      its neighbors and
                      beyond. Afghanistan is strategically located at the crossroads of South Asia, Central Asia and the
                      Middle East. It could
                      benefit from trade, transit, energy and connectivity projects that link these regions. For
                      instance, Afghanistan could
                      participate in the Turkmenistan-Afghanistan-Pakistan-India (TAPI) gas pipeline project or the
                      Central Asia-South Asia
                      (CASA-1000) electricity transmission project. It could also join regional platforms such as the
                      Shanghai Cooperation
                      Organization (SCO) or the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). However, this
                      will require political
                      stability, security cooperation and trust-building among the regional actors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A fourth opportunity for Afghanistan is to initiate a dialogue with the Taliban and other
                      stakeholders to achieve a
                      political settlement and a lasting peace. The Taliban have stated that they are willing to form an
                      inclusive government
                      and engage with other Afghan factions as well as the international community. The UN has also
                      called for a resumption of
                      peace talks among Afghans under its auspices. A negotiated solution could end decades of war and
                      violence in Afghanistan
                      and pave the way for reconstruction and reconciliation. However, this will require compromise,
                      consensus and commitment
                      from all sides involved.
                    </p>
                    <b>Challenges</b>
                    <p>
                      One of the challenges for Afghanistan is to address its insecurity and terrorism threats that pose
                      risks to its
                      stability and development. The Taliban have not been able to establish effective control over the
                      entire country or
                      prevent attacks by rival groups such as the Islamic State (IS) or local militias. The Taliban have
                      also faced resistance
                      from some segments of society who oppose their rule or demand their rights. The security situation
                      remains volatile and
                      unpredictable, with frequent clashes, bombings and assassinations. The withdrawal of US and NATO
                      forces has also reduced
                      their counterterrorism capabilities and intelligence support in Afghanistan.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Another challenge for Afghanistan is to tackle its poverty and humanitarian crisis that affect
                      millions of people across
                      the country. According to the World Bank1, Afghanistan’s economy contracted by about 20% in 2021
                      due to a sharp decline
                      in public spending, lower household incomes and reduced consumption. Poverty is expected to remain
                      widespread, with over
                      two-thirds of households struggling to cover basic expenses. The humanitarian situation is also
                      dire, with more than 18
                      million people in need of assistance2, including food, water, health care, shelter and protection.
                      The COVID-19 pandemic
                      has further exacerbated these challenges.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A third challenge for Afghanistan is to protect its human rights and uphold its international
                      obligations that are
                      essential for its legitimacy and credibility. The Taliban have been accused of committing serious
                      human rights
                      violations against civilians, especially women, girls and minorities. The Taliban have also
                      imposed a strict
                      interpretation of Islamic law and restricted basic freedoms such as expression, assembly and
                      movement. The Taliban have
                      also failed to honor their commitments under the Doha agreement with the US, such as cutting ties
                      with al-Qaeda and
                      other terrorist groups or releasing prisoners. The Taliban have also faced international isolation
                      and sanctions due to
                      their actions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      A fourth challenge for Afghanistan is to reform its governance and institutions that are crucial
                      for its functionality
                      and accountability. The Taliban have not yet formed a representative and inclusive government that
                      reflects the
                      diversity and aspirations of the Afghan people. The Taliban have also not established a clear
                      legal and administrative
                      framework that defines the roles and responsibilities of different authorities and agencies. The
                      Taliban have also not
                      addressed the issues of corruption, mismanagement and inefficiency that plagued the previous
                      government. The Taliban
                      have also not restored the banking system and payment services that are vital for the economy and
                      aid delivery.
                    </p>
                    <b>Conclusion</b>
                    <p>
                      Afghanistan is undergoing a major transition that will have profound implications for its future.
                      The country faces
                      enormous opportunities and challenges in the next decade that will require vision, leadership and
                      cooperation from all
                      stakeholders. The international community has a role to play in supporting Afghanistan’s peace and
                      development, but
                      ultimately the fate of Afghanistan lies in the hands of its own people.

                  The withdrawal of NATO forces has left a power vacuum in Afghanistan, which was quickly filled by

                    <b>For Afghanistan</b>
                    <p>
                      The withdrawal of NATO forces has left a power vacuum in Afghanistan, which was quickly filled by
                      the Taliban, the
                      Islamist militant group that ruled the country from 1996 to 2001. The Taliban launched a sweeping
                      offensive in May 2021,
                      capturing most of the country’s districts and provincial capitals, including Kabul, the capital
                      city. The Afghan
                      government and the Afghan National Defence and Security Forces (ANDSF), which had been trained and
                      supported by NATO for
                      years, collapsed in a matter of weeks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The Taliban takeover has triggered a humanitarian crisis in Afghanistan, with millions of people
                      fleeing their homes,
                      seeking safety and basic services. Many Afghans fear a return to the harsh rule of the Taliban,
                      which imposed a strict
                      interpretation of Islamic law and denied basic rights to women and minorities. The Taliban have
                      promised to respect
                      human rights and form an inclusive government, but their actions have raised doubts about their
                      sincerity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      The withdrawal of NATO forces has also created a security vacuum in Afghanistan, which could be
                      exploited by terrorist
                      groups such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State (IS). Both groups have a history of operating in
                      Afghanistan and have
                      vowed to continue their fight against the West. The Taliban have pledged to prevent Afghanistan
                      from becoming a safe
                      haven for terrorists, but their relationship with al-Qaeda remains unclear. The US and its allies
                      have retained the
                      capability to conduct counterterrorism operations in Afghanistan from over the horizon, but their
                      effectiveness and
                      accuracy may be limited by the lack of intelligence and local partners on the ground.
                    </p>
                    <b>For the region</b>
                    <p>
                      The withdrawal of NATO forces has reshaped the geopolitical landscape in South and Central Asia.

                      countries of Afghanistan have been affected by the influx of refugees, the threat of instability
                      and violence spilling
                      over their borders, and the emergence of new opportunities and challenges for cooperation and
                      competition.

                    <p>
                      Pakistan, which shares a long and porous border with Afghanistan, has been accused of supporting
                      the Taliban for decades
                      as a way to counter India’s influence in the region. Pakistan has welcomed the Taliban’s return to
                      power as a victory
                      for its strategic interests, but it also faces the risk of increased terrorism and radicalization
                      within its own
                      territory. Pakistan has also been trying to balance its relations with China, its main ally and
                      economic partner, and
                      the US, its former ally and aid donor.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Iran, which also shares a border with Afghanistan, has been wary of the Taliban’s Sunni ideology
                      and their treatment of
                      Shia minorities. Iran has maintained contacts with the Taliban as well as other Afghan factions to
                      protect its interests
                      and influence in Afghanistan. Iran has also been seeking to expand its ties with China and Russia,
                      which have been
                      critical of the US withdrawal and have expressed interest in engaging with the Taliban.
                    </p>
                    <p>India, which has invested billions of dollars in development projects and diplomatic initiatives
                      in Afghanistan, has
                      been alarmed by the Taliban’s takeover and its implications for India’s security and regional
                      role. India has been a
                      target of terrorist attacks by groups linked to Pakistan and the Taliban. India has also been
                      competing with China for
                      influence and resources in South Asia. India has not recognized the Taliban as the legitimate
                      government of Afghanistan,
                      but it has opened channels of communication with them.</p>
                    <p>China, which borders Afghanistan through a narrow corridor in its western region of Xinjiang, has
                      been concerned about
                      the potential spillover of terrorism and instability into its territory. China has also been
                      eyeing Afghanistan’s rich
                      mineral resources and strategic location as part of its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a global
                      infrastructure and
                      investment project. China has recognized the Taliban as the de facto authority in Afghanistan, but
                      it has also urged
                      them to cut ties with terrorist groups and respect human rights.</p>
                    <p>Russia, which invaded Afghanistan in 1979 and withdrew in 1989 after a decade-long war against
                      mujahideen fighters
                      backed by the US and Pakistan, has been watching the US withdrawal with a mix of satisfaction and
                      apprehension. Russia
                      has accused the US of creating chaos and leaving behind a security threat in Afghanistan. Russia
                      has also been
                      cultivating relations with the Taliban as well as other regional actors such as Iran, China,
                      Pakistan and India to
                      protect its interests and influence in Central Asia.</p>
                    <b>For NATO</b>
                    <p>The withdrawal of NATO forces from Afghanistan has raised questions about the future of the
                      alliance, its mission and
                      its relevance. The decision to withdraw was made by the US, the leader and largest contributor of
                      NATO, without
                      sufficient consultation and coordination with its allies. The execution of the withdrawal was
                      chaotic and hasty, leaving
                      behind thousands of Afghans who had worked with NATO and were eligible for evacuation. The
                      withdrawal also exposed the
                      lack of unity and trust among NATO members, as well as the gaps in their capabilities and
                      resources.</p>
                    <p>The withdrawal of NATO forces from Afghanistan has also challenged the alliance’s core values and
                      principles, such as
                      democracy, human rights and the rule of law. The withdrawal has been seen by some as a betrayal of
                      the Afghan people,
                      especially women and girls, who had made significant gains in education, health and political
                      participation under NATO’s
                      protection. The withdrawal has also been seen by some as a failure of the alliance’s collective
                      defense and security
                      objectives, which were invoked for the first time after the 9/11 attacks.</p>
                    <p>The withdrawal of NATO forces from Afghanistan has also implications for the alliance’s global
                      role and reputation. The
                      withdrawal has been perceived by some as a sign of weakness and retreat by the West, which could
                      embolden its
                      adversaries such as Russia, China, Iran and North Korea. The withdrawal has also been perceived by
                      some as a loss of
                      credibility and reliability by the West, which could undermine its alliances and partnerships with
                      other countries and
                      regions.</p>
                    <b>Conclusion</b>
                    <p>The withdrawal of NATO forces from Afghanistan is a historic event that marks the end of a long
                      and costly war. The
                      withdrawal has profound consequences for Afghanistan, the region and NATO, which will have to deal
                      with the political,
                      humanitarian, security and strategic implications for years to come. The withdrawal also presents
                      an opportunity for
                      reflection and learning for NATO, which will have to adapt to a changing world and address new
                      challenges and threats.
                      The withdrawal also presents an opportunity for dialogue and cooperation for Afghanistan and its
                      neighbors, which will
                      have to find ways to achieve peace and stability in their common interest.</p>
